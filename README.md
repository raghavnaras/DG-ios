# Digital Gym iOS Application 

This is the iOS for the Digital Gym project under Rice University's Scalable Health Labs. It includes a login page, a chart of recent workout data, and a QR code scanner where users can scan the QR code of their workout bike to see live data like RPM. 

Here is a link to a demo of the application at it's current state: https://youtu.be/txguU7fPqOk
